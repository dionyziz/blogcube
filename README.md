BlogCube is a blogging system in PHP, MySQL, Javascript, and HTML/CSS that we developed as a team of programmers in 2005 - 2006.

Features
========

The main unique features of BlogCube were the simplicity of its interface, the AJAX-based interface which was an innovation at its time, and several pioneer features such as LaTeX embedding support and comment color-coding.

History
=======

BlogCube was developed as a commercial blogging platform at the time WordPress, a free alternative, started becoming popular. As a team, we worked as volunteers for about two years developing the software, but abandoned the project which was failing mainly due to management issues, strong competition and a demoralized team. We only released a closed beta to a restricted group of testers.

Open sourcing
=============

After this time, as the project leader, I am publishing it under the MIT license. The reasons for making this open source are the following:

 * To allow other people to access the know-how we developed and learn from it.
 * To allow reuse of our code in other projects.
 * To give back to the community since we used many open source tools.
 * To allow the contributors to show off their code openly as they see fit.
 * To give clear access to the original team to the code they have developed.
 * To learn from our mistakes by clearly pointing out each step in our path of learning.

Using and studying BlogCube
===========================
BlogCube is a working system. You are free and welcome to upload it on your own servers and use it as your blogging system. Even though it is working, it is not as good, complete, or extensible as other blogging platforms such as WordPress. BlogCube is no longer developed nor supported. We encourage you to consider alternatives if you want a system that is secure, robust, and more importantly supported.

The code you will find in this repository illustrates some good and some bad coding practices. It also contains many great and many terrible ideas on structuring code and code architecture that you can learn from; you can learn from both the good and the bad. Overall, it is an educational piece of software to read critically, keeping in mind that it's far from perfect. We hope you learn something from it, and we would be happy to see code portions being used in your own software.

This software is not a prime example of software architecture. It was written by students with limited experience in writing production code. As such, we urge you not to use this software in production or deploy it in large scale.
